# Nonlinear Optics Simulation

A repository for simulating nonlinear optical phenomena and applications in photonic systems.

## Overview
This project focuses on modeling and simulating various nonlinear optical effects, providing tools for analysis and visualization of nonlinear processes in optical systems. The simulation framework aims to provide accurate predictions of nonlinear interactions in photonic devices and systems.

## Features
- Simulation of key nonlinear optical processes:
  - Second-harmonic generation (SHG)
  - Third-harmonic generation (THG)
  - Four-wave mixing (FWM)
  - Self-phase modulation (SPM)
  - Cross-phase modulation (XPM)
  - Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)
- Advanced analysis tools for optical systems
- Visualization capabilities for simulation results
- Parameter sweep functionality for optimization studies
- Support for various material models and dispersion profiles

## Applications
- Optical frequency comb generation
- Supercontinuum generation
- Parametric amplification
- Nonlinear waveguide optimization
- Soliton dynamics

## Getting Started
Documentation and setup instructions will be added soon.

## Research Notes
- When measuring asymmetric nonlinear responses, monitor both input and output channels carefully
- For wavelength sweeps, record input power as a function of time to account for laser power variations
- Calibrate power meters before each measurement session
