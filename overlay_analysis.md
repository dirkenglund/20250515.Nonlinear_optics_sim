## Simulation vs Experimental Data Comparison

I've created an overlay comparison between our simulation and the experimental data from Figure 3b. This direct visual comparison allows us to evaluate how well our model captures the key features of the experimental spectrum.

### Key Observations

1. **Peak Positions**: The simulation correctly identifies the four main peaks at approximately 1393 nm, 1395 nm, 1397.5 nm, and 1400 nm.

2. **Relative Peak Heights**: The simulation captures the relative heights of the peaks, with the primary peak at 1397.5 nm being the tallest, followed by the peaks at 1395 nm and 1400 nm, and the smallest peak at 1393 nm.

3. **Peak Widths**: The experimental data shows broader peaks than our simulation. This suggests that additional broadening mechanisms may be present in the experimental setup, such as:
   - Temperature fluctuations
   - Waveguide imperfections
   - Higher-order mode interactions
   - Measurement resolution limitations

4. **Asymmetry**: While our simulation implements asymmetric peak shapes, the experimental data shows more complex asymmetry patterns, particularly in the wings of the peaks.

5. **Background Level**: The experimental data has a higher and more variable background level between peaks compared to our simulation.

### Potential Improvements

To further improve the match between simulation and experiment, we could:

1. Implement a more sophisticated peak broadening model that accounts for multiple physical mechanisms

2. Refine the asymmetry model to better capture the complex shape of each individual peak

3. Add a more realistic background model that accounts for noise sources in the experimental setup

4. Include effects of higher-order modes and cross-coupling between modes

5. Model temperature and power-dependent effects on the phase-matching spectrum

### Physical Interpretation

The differences between simulation and experiment highlight the complexity of real-world quantum frequency conversion systems. While the basic three-wave mixing model captures the essential physics, the experimental system includes additional effects such as:

- Waveguide mode dispersion
- Non-uniform poling periods
- Thermal gradients
- Pump depletion effects
- Raman scattering and other noise sources

These effects contribute to the broader, more asymmetric peaks observed in the experimental data.

Despite these differences, our simulation successfully reproduces the key features of the experimental spectrum, confirming that the underlying physics model is sound and providing a good foundation for understanding the quantum frequency conversion process in PPLN waveguides.
