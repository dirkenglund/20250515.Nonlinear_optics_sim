\textbf{Photon conversion efficiency.}
\textbf{(a)}
Phase matching map of the PPLN waveguide as a function of networking wavelength and waveguide temperature. Global maximum is indicated with a star, at $T = 55$ C and $\lambda_{n} = 1397.5$ nm. 
\textbf{(b)} Phase matching as a function of the networking wavelength, for six external pump powers, at $T = 55$ C. The phase matching bandwidth, according to the full-width half maximum (FWHM) of the most prominent peak, is $1.0$ nm. 
\textbf{(c)} External photon conversion efficiency for the fiber-coupled PPLN waveguide. We report a fitted (measured, based on datapoints) conversion efficiency $\eta_{\mathrm{ext}} = 43 \pm 1.8$~\% ($44.5$~\%).  
The corresponding internal photon conversion efficiency, which ignores the losses due to fiber coupling, is $\eta_{\mathrm{int}} = 96 \pm 1.8$~\% ($98.5$~\%). The maximal conversion efficiency is achieved at external (internal) pump power of $1.51 \pm 0.01$ W ($0.97 \pm 0.01$ W). 
\textbf{(d)} Review on external photon conversion efficiencies and their noise spectral densities (NSD). 
\textbf{(e)} Noise spectral densities as a function of the networking wavelength minus the pump wavelength.
